## Boston Housing Dataset Shiny App

This is a Shiny App for [the Boston Housing Dataset](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston) which is the final project of my ST558 class.

* Use RStudio to create a new project from git repository
* Copy the GitHub repository address to the new project
* Open `server.R` or `ui.R` and then click `Run App` in RStudio
